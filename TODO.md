TODO list:
- Develop an XML parser which will allow live editing as in XAML like IDEs
- Create a bottom panel which will be used by the XML parser to create objects only by typing as XML structures(It will be an XML live Editor)
- Implement Export and Load features
- Develop a selectable Panel to add objects and remove from a ComboBox
- Create a FilePicker for OnMouseOver and OnMouseOut textures
- Make each PropertyPanel category as an IFrame, so it will more organized as each UIOBject has its own set of specific properties which differ from each other
- and much more to come !
